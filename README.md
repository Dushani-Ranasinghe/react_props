# react_props
A simple project to display lists of data using react props, lists and maps.  User data from randomuser.me and Styles using react-bootsrap

REACT PROPS:
Props is simply stands for "properties".
We use props to pass data from one component to another .

map() function:
This is an array method which is used to render lists with some type of loop.
When using this function it is important to use a KEY for each object in the array list, because it helps to keep track of elements.


In this project we get some user details from randomuser.me and hardcode it into an object array. Then using map() function we pass these props to a list and display them.
